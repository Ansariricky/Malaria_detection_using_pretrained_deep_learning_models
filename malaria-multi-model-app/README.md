# Malaria Detection AI



## Overview

Malaria Detection AI is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages deep learning models to classify blood smear images as **Parasitized** or **Uninfected**. The app utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3) for accurate prediction and provides Grad-CAM visualizations to explain model decisions, enhancing interpretability and trust.

> **Note:** This tool is intended for **educational and research purposes only** and should not be used as a medical diagnostic tool.
