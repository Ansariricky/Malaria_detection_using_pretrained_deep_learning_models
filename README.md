# Malaria_detection_using_pretrained_deep_learning_models

## Overview

Malaria Detection AI is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages deep learning models to classify blood smear images as **Parasitized** or **Uninfected**. The app utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3) for accurate prediction and provides Grad-CAM visualizations to explain model decisions, enhancing interpretability and trust.

> **Note:** This tool is intended for **educational and research purposes only** and should not be used as a medical diagnostic tool.

## Features

- Upload blood smear images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- Select between MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 deep learning models.
- Real-time prediction of malaria infection status.
- Confidence score with interpretative guidance on prediction reliability.
- Grad-CAM heatmap visualization highlighting image regions influencing the model's decision.
- Informative UI designed for accessibility and user engagement.
